    "The flow diagram illustrates the process of fine-tuning a Large Language Model (LLM), which includes the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prepare Environment**: Download the necessary data and install the required libraries to begin fine-tuning.\n",
    "2. **Fine-Tune Model**: Begin fine-tuning the Large Language Model (LLM) with specific data and configurations.\n",
    "3. **Load Your Fine-Tuned Model**: Since we are doing fine-tuning with LoRA, and the output only provides model adapters (not the entire fine-tuned model), we need to load these adapters alongside the pretrained model.\n",
    "4. **Merge and Save the Fine-Tuned Model**: We then combine the model adapters with the pretrained model in order to use the fine-tuned model.\n",
    "5. **Load Base Model and Fine-Tuned Model**: Load both the original base (pretrained) model and the fully fine-tuned model to generate output using predefined questions.\n",
    "6. **Evaluate Model Responses Against Ground Truths**: Assess the model's performance and accuracy by testing its output against a set of known correct answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the example, you can point to **Run in Colab** or **View Source on GitHub** to see the source repo."
